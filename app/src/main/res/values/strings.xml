    <string name="prickly_heat_description">
        Prickly heat, also called heat rash or miliaria, is a skin rash caused by blocked sweat ducts, leading to trapped sweat beneath the skin. It is characterized by red bumps or blisters and an itchy, prickly sensation, and it typically occurs in hot, humid climates or when the skin is covered and unable to "breathe". The condition is usually harmless and resolves on its own when the skin is cooled and kept dry.
